I won't win a pulitzer prize.

But I write a little bit here and there, about the little bit that I know.

Most of my days used to be filled with hair.

I pushed my equipment into the room and introduced myself to someone who could hear me, or, something that had no need to. The air is immersed in a pool of urine and sanitizer. As my latex-free gloves squeeze over my hands (they never have extra large on this floor), I plug in. I move the patients limp wrist to ensure they are who, or what, I'm looking for. Setup is quick - time is money. Before long my hands are on the scalp, in needs-to-be-washed hair, as I sweat and struggle to manipulate their head around the tubes that go in and out of it; a perforated medusa, with a perm that is thinning and unopening eyes.

This job is hard.

Not hard in a technical sense. Hard because as I sit down in front of my station, open the approperiate software, and hit "record", I see your mind.

Or I see nothing. And as this machine helps decide whether your mind is alive, and whether your body will live or die, my own mind plays tricks on itself, a disgruntled old man, jibing another for his lack of skill and temperance.

Why is it that every 70-something year old woman looks like the woman who raised me?

Why is it that every open-mouthed, unconscious patient I see looks like the woman I saw, gourneyed out of her home, gone before I was ready for her to go?

This job is hard. But in this economy, what can you do? Who cares if your paycheck is handed to you, equal parts currency and border-line mental abuse. You've gotta eat. 

Like how you fed me, when I was just a little boy.

My voice is absorbed by the technology filled room as I explain (for legal reasons, ya know), for my patient to keep her eyes shut while the extendable lamp flashes just inches above her face. I imagine that it warms her cold skin. As I wash the conductant off of the electrodes in the sink next to the bed, in full view of the window that shows nurses passing by busily, doctors texting on iphones, and families bustling, red faced but polite, I push my consciousness into the gray cloud of obscurity that dulls all feeling. You can't show emotion in scrubs, other than brisk affirmation toward superiors, empty complacence towards those who are actually aware of what they're being treated for, and hints of aggravation toward those who speak the words, "Well, I read on Web M.D...." 

At the end of the day as I flip through channels at home, Jeopardy comes on, and through my hazy gray cloud I see your smiling face, as I deftly defeat the competitors, all of which are under age 13\. I don't know if there's someplace that we go when it's all over. But regardless of what happens, or where you are, and if you are....I miss you.
