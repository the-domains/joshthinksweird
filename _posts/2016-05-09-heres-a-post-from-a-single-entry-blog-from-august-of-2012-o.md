_Here's a post from a single entry blog from August of 2012 or 2013\._

I look at my old writings and the praise I got for them and I'm uneasy. I read and see the holes, the lack of depth in what didn't have holes, and that all of my poetry centered around women. I appreciate work because it gives me a focus. I'm in a field with products I understand, but the products aren't my focus anymore. It's the people. 

There comes a point in time when you've completed a task so many times that you no longer have to put energy into it. You are shaken from your thought process, alerted somehow, that the task has to be completed and you complete it. Once it's done, you're free to continue on to the thought process you had before. My thoughts revolve, almost completely, around how to elevate the people around me. How do I make them more successful? More effective? Happier? 

I have always wanted to be able to confidently grasp a basketball with one hand. I can almost do it! My fingers creak and my palms ache and I can suspend it above the ground for just a few seconds before it hits the pavement. That's how I feel about this. I've almost got it, nearly there, I just need to grow a tiny bit more so I have a better grasp. I'll get there, soon.
